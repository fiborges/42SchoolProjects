## ðŸ“¦ **Building and Cleaning**
Within each module, you'll discover multiple exercises, each equipped with its own Makefile for easy management. 
To compile the exercises, simply execute:
```ssh
make
```
from within the exercise folder. 
This will generate an executable for you to run.

If you wish to tidy up the folder and remove the executable, utilize the make fclean command. Keep your workspace organized effortlessly!

This repository contains solutions for exercises from modules 5 to 9 of the C++ course.
Module 5: Exceptions
Concepts Covered:
Exception Handling in C++:

The use of exceptions as a mechanism for signaling and handling errors or unexpected conditions.
Handling Errors:

The importance of robust error-handling code in making a program user-friendly.
Error Types:

Distinguishing between different types of errors and determining the appropriate way to handle them.
Resource Consumption:

The resource implications of using exceptions versus other error-handling mechanisms.
Key Takeaways:

Exceptions are used for error conditions not expected in the normal course of events. Quality error-handling code improves program robustness and user-friendliness. Choose error-handling mechanisms based on the nature and frequency of errors.
Module 6: Intro to STL Containers
Concepts Covered:
STL Containers Overview:

Introduction to STL (Standard Template Library) containers and their role in C++ programming.
Sequence Containers:

Arrays, vectors, forward lists, lists, deques, and their characteristics.
Container Adapters:

Stack, queue, and priority_queue as wrappers around other container types.
Associative Containers:

Sets, maps, multiset, and multimap for associative data structures.
Unordered Associative Containers:

Unordered sets, unordered maps, unordered multiset, and unordered multimap.
Key Takeaways:

STL containers provide efficient implementations of common data structures. Choose containers based on the trade-offs in complexity for different operations.
Module 7: std::vector and std::list
Concepts Covered:
std::vector:

Dynamic arrays that can change in size efficiently.
std::list:

Doubly-linked lists allowing constant time insert and erase operations.
std::map:

Associative container storing key-value pairs sorted by keys.
std::stack:

Container adapter providing LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.
Iterators:

Objects designed to traverse through a container.
Key Takeaways:

std::vector provides dynamic arrays with efficient element access and dynamic growth. std::list offers constant time insert and erase operations anywhere in the sequence. std::map is an associative container with key-value pairs sorted by keys.
Module 8: STL Algorithms and Iterators
Concepts Covered:
STL Algorithms:

Pre-written algorithms operating on iterators.
Iterator Adapters:

Creating different types of iterators like std::ostream_iterator.
Insert Iterators:

std::inserter, std::back_inserter, std::front_inserter for inserting values into containers.
Common Traits Among Iterators:

Creation, advancement, and comparison of iterators.
Key Takeaways:

STL algorithms provide efficient operations on various containers. Iterator adapters and insert iterators enhance flexibility and functionality. Understanding and utilizing common traits among iterators.
Module 9: More STL and Sorting Algorithms
Concepts Covered:
Handling Files in C++:

File handling using ifstream and reading data from CSV files.
Handling Dates and Floating-Point Values:

Processing dates and values for financial calculations.
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):

Evaluating mathematical expressions in RPN.
Merge-Insertion Sort Algorithm:

Sorting positive integer sequences using different containers.
Key Takeaways:
Efficiently handling files in C++ and processing data. Implementing algorithms for evaluating RPN expressions. Comparing the efficiency of different containers for sorting operations. Understanding and implementing the merge-insertion sort algorithm.

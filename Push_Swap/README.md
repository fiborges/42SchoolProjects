## 💡 About the project

This project comprises an interesting case study regarding sorting algorithms and its performances, being part of the core curriculum of all 42 schools worldwide. The task is simple: given a sequence of random numbers disposed in a stack data structure (**stack A**), sort them with the help of an empty auxiliary stack (**stack B**) and a set of specific stack operations. The operations allowed are described as follows, as written in our task:

- **`sa`** : **swap a** - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- **`sb`** : **swap b** - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- **`ss`** : **`sa`** and **`sb`** at the same time.
- **`pa`** : **push a** - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if B is empty.
- **`pb`** : **push b** - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if A is empty.
- **`ra`** : **rotate a** - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **`rb`** : **rotate b** - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- **`rr`** : **`ra`** and **`rb`** at the same time.
- **`rra`** : **reverse rotate a** - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **`rrb`** : **reverse rotate b** - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- **`rrr`** : **`rra`** and **`rrb`** at the same time.

## 💡 Testing

Download to your computer, go to the directory push_swap, compile with make and then run push_swap with unique numbers.
 - Ex:
./push_swap 5 10 3 0 -12
